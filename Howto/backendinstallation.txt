TODO: phpmyadmin installation

first install nginx with php.. if that's working than you can install phpmyadmin
to install (sudo pacman -S phpmyadmin)

phpmyadmin will be installed in /usr/share/webapps/phpMyAdmin. copy it to the nginx directory /usr/share/nginx/html

to connect with your database make sure maridb(mysql) is runnng		

TODO: Nginx installation 
https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/nginx#Installation

for database management we use phpmyadmin and nginx.. 

to install nginx do (sudo pacman -S nginx)

start nginx (systemctl start nginx)

to get phpmyadmin running we need database and php.. first install php (sudo pacman -S php)

after php installation open the /etc/php/php.ini file and uncomment the line extension=mysqli.so

now php is configured and installed.. we need to tell nginx to parse php files

for this we use php-fpm install it with pacman (sudo pacman -S php-fpm)

start sudo systemctl start php-fpm

add the following to nginx.conf to php-fpm working

all code need to be put in the server block

location ~ \.php$ {
     fastcgi_pass   unix:/run/php-fpm/php-fpm.sock;
     fastcgi_index  index.php;
     include        fastcgi.conf;
}

don't forget to put the root element in the scope of the server block like this

server {
    listen 80;
    server_name localhost;
    root /usr/share/nginx/html;
    location / {
        index index.html index.htm index.php;
    }

    location ~ \.php$ {
        #fastcgi_pass 127.0.0.1:9000; (depending on your php-fpm socket configuration)
        fastcgi_pass unix:/run/php-fpm/php-fpm.sock;
        fastcgi_index index.php;
        include fastcgi.conf;
    }



after adding don't forget to restart nginx and php-fpm

to test php-fpm and nginx go to localhost 

put php file test.php in the directory usr/share/nginx/html  with the following context

<?php
 phpinfo();
?>

if php gives you a error like "no input file specified" or just refused to work.. check php.ini and comment out the line with open_basedir=..... 



TODO: ruby installation

for the installation of ruby on rails and stuff install ruby first (sudo pacman -S ruby)

after ruby is installed we can make use of gem to install rails (gem install rails)
for you can do the rails server command you need to add it to the Path (PATH=$PATH:/home/patrick/.gem/ruby/2.1.0/bin)
before you can run (rails server) we need to run (bundle install) to install missing gems

if you get an error about Javascript and such install also nodejs (sudo pacman -S nodejs)


TODO: python installation 

For the pythonserver.py to work correctly we need the following libraries installed with pip.. 
pip install requests
pip install numpy
pip install Pillow

sudo systemctl start mysqld
sudo systemctl start php-fpm
sudo systemctl start nginx
