TODO: phpmyadmin installation

first install nginx with php.. if that's working than you can install phpmyadmin
to install (sudo pacman -S phpmyadmin)

phpmyadmin will be installed in /usr/share/webapps/phpMyAdmin. copy it to the nginx directory /usr/share/nginx/html

to connect with your database make sure maridb(mysql) is runnng		

TODO: Nginx installation 
https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/nginx#Installation

for database management we use phpmyadmin and nginx.. 

to install nginx do (sudo pacman -S nginx)

start nginx (systemctl start nginx)

to get phpmyadmin running we need database and php.. first install php (sudo pacman -S php)

after php installation open the /etc/php/php.ini file and uncomment the line extension=mysqli.so

now php is configured and installed.. we need to tell nginx to parse php files

for this we use php-fpm install it with pacman (sudo pacman -S php-fpm)

start sudo systemctl start php-fpm

add the following to nginx.conf to php-fpm working

all code need to be put in the server block

location ~ \.php$ {
     fastcgi_pass   unix:/run/php-fpm/php-fpm.sock;
     fastcgi_index  index.php;
     include        fastcgi.conf;
}

don't forget to put the root element in the scope of the server block like this

server {
    listen 80;
    server_name localhost;
    root /usr/share/nginx/html;
    location / {
        index index.html index.htm index.php;
    }

    location ~ \.php$ {
        #fastcgi_pass 127.0.0.1:9000; (depending on your php-fpm socket configuration)
        fastcgi_pass unix:/run/php-fpm/php-fpm.sock;
        fastcgi_index index.php;
        include fastcgi.conf;
    }



after adding don't forget to restart nginx and php-fpm

to test php-fpm and nginx go to localhost 

put php file test.php in the directory usr/share/nginx/html  with the following context

<?php
 phpinfo();
?>

if php gives you a error like "no input file specified" or just refused to work.. check php.ini and comment out the line with open_basedir=.....
